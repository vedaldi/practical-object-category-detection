    "# Object category detection practical\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an [Oxford Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg) computer vision practical, authored by [Andrea Vedaldi](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) and Andrew Zisserman (Release 2018a).\n",

    "The goal of *object category detection* is to identify and localize objects of a given type in an image. Examples applications include detecting pedestrian, cars, or traffic signs in street scenes, objects of interest such as tools or animals in web images, or particular features in medical image. Given a target class, such as *people*, a *detector* receives as input an image and produces as output zero, one, or more bounding boxes around each occurrence of the object class in the image. The key challenge is that the detector needs to find objects regardless of their location and scale in the image, as well as pose and other variation factors, such as clothing, illumination, occlusions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical explores basic techniques in visual object detection, focusing on  *image based models*. The appearance of image patches containing objects is learned using statistical analysis. Then, in order to detect objects in an image, the statistical model is applied to image windows extracted at all possible scales and locations, in order to identify which ones, if any, contain the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, the practical explores the following topics: (i) using HOG features to describe image regions, (ii) building a HOG-based sliding-window detector to localize objects in images; (iii) working with multiple scales and multiple object occurrences; (iv) using a linear support vector machine to learn the appearance of objects; (v) evaluating an object detector in term of average precision; (vi) learning an object detector using hard negative mining.\n",

    "Now let us apply flipping to the model trained earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task:** Let `w` be the model you trained before. Use the procedure to flip HOG to generate `w_flipped`. Then visualize both `w` and `w_flipped` as done in [Sect. 1.3](#sect13). Convince yourself that flipping was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now two models, `w` and `w_flipped`, one for each view of the object.\n",
