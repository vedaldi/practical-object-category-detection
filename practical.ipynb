    "# Object category detection practical\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an [Oxford Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg) computer vision practical, authored by [Andrea Vedaldi](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) and Andrew Zisserman (Release 2018a).\n",

    "The goal of *object category detection* is to identify and localize objects of a given type in an image. Examples applications include detecting pedestrian, cars, or traffic signs in street scenes, objects of interest such as tools or animals in web images, or particular features in medical image. Given a target class, such as *people*, a *detector* receives as input an image and produces as output zero, one, or more bounding boxes around each occurrence of the object class in the image. The key challenge is that the detector needs to find objects regardless of their location and scale in the image, as well as pose and other variation factors, such as clothing, illumination, occlusions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical explores basic techniques in visual object detection, focusing on  *image based models*. The appearance of image patches containing objects is learned using statistical analysis. Then, in order to detect objects in an image, the statistical model is applied to image windows extracted at all possible scales and locations, in order to identify which ones, if any, contain the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, the practical explores the following topics: (i) using HOG features to describe image regions, (ii) building a HOG-based sliding-window detector to localize objects in images; (iii) working with multiple scales and multiple object occurrences; (iv) using a linear support vector machine to learn the appearance of objects; (v) evaluating an object detector in term of average precision; (vi) learning an object detector using hard negative mining.\n",

    "## Part 4: Hard negative mining {#part4}\n",
    "\n",
    "This part explores more advanced learning methods. So far, the SVM has been learned using a small and randomly sampled number of negative examples. However, in principle, every single patch that does not contain the object can be considered as a negative sample. These are of course too many to be used in practice; unfortunately, random sampling is ineffective as the most interesting (confusing) negative samples are a very small and special subset of all the possible ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hard negative mining* is a simple technique that allows finding a small set of key negative examples. The idea is simple: we start by initializing the model randomly, and then we alternate between evaluating the model on the training data to find erroneous responses and adding the corresponding examples to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4.1: Train with hard negative mining {#stage4.1}\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `collect_hard_negatives` is called by the previously-defined function `evaluate_model` after the detector is run on each image to extract the HOG descriptors of the hardest negative patches. These patches are the ones that are highly scored by the models *and* incorrect according to the evaluation procedure. Recall that the result of the evaluation is a label which is +1 for good detections and -1 for incorrect ones. Collectively, these labels are stored in a $N$ tensor `labels` for a $N\\times 4$ tensor `boxes` of detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "`boxes` is expressed in pixels, whereas we need to obtain the corresponding HOG descriptors. In order to do so, each box coordinates are revese-mapped to a certain scale pyramid level, and then the corresponding HOG patch is extracted.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 5.2: Learn the model\n",
    "\n",

Handling these effects requires additional sophistications, including using deformable templates, and a mixture of multiple templates.\n",

    "In particular, many objects in nature are symmetric and, as such, their images appear flipped when the objects are seen from the left or the right direction (consider for example a face). This can be handled by a pair of symmetric HOG templates. In this part we will explore this option.\n",
